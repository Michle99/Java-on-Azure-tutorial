- Connect your application to a MySQL database.
- Deploy the web application to Azure App Service.

# Introduction to Azure App Service
Azure App Service allows you to host your company's websites, web applications, REST APIs, and other application code on Azure. Running your web application in Azure App Service provides you with all the benefits of running on Azure: your application is available, it scales, and it has built-in security and compliance.

You want to create a Spring Boot application that hosts its logic in Azure App Service and hosts its database in an Azure MySQL database.

# Develop your Spring app
Spring is a great framework to host and manage your applications. You just wire certain Spring components without needing to manage the underlying server runtime.

You've decided to use Spring Boot. This framework is self-hosted, and it provides support services to run your application.

The Spring injection annotations use dependency injection to process the components. You can use Azure Spring Starter integration libraries to configure and set up connections to Azure services.
